# Maplemap
MapleMap Inspector tools read Map.wz XMLs and shows a clean, counted summary (backgrounds, objects, mobs/NPCs, tiles) with an expandable tree, per file miniMap preview, multi file tabs, and mouse wheel switching all in one simple UI. Great for importing a new area when you’re not sure which assets you need to make it work.
